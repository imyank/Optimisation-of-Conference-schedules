# Optimisation-of-Conference-schedules

Inputs Taken in following formats:

papers_per_session
parallel_sessions
time
C
n=papers_per_session*parallel_sessions*time


Algorithm: First choice Hill climbing


Steps used:


1. Created a temporary shuffle function which will iterate through the papers_per_session, parallel_sessions and time. 
   This function will produce a sequence which will be utilised to calculate goodness score.
2. Difference and Similarity matrix(1- Difference matrix) are calculated.
3. Overall_goodness_score function calculates the total goodness value from the formula given and by traversing the 
   three nested loops of papers_per_session, parallel_sessions and time.
4. In Modified hill climbing, iterations taken are around 1250. A temp_var variable is taken which acts as a flag. 
   The schedule from the shuffle function is taken and a temporary goodness value is calculated.
5.  While iterating through three nested loops, random successors are generated by swapping the papers_per_session, 
    parallel_sessions and time, which is governed by random function(probability>0.5 & probability<=0.5)
6.  After swapping, the max goodness score is calculated 
7.  The schedule at which max score comes is stored in the variable global_sch
8.  Incremented one value in schedule for the desired output.
9.  Finally printing the result
